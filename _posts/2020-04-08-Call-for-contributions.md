title: Conformance Checking Challenge 2020
---
# Call for contributions

The 2nd Conformance Checking Challenge 2020 (CCC20) is a co-located event of the 2nd International Conference on Process Mining 2020. The Challenge provides participants with artifacts stemmed from a real process, and invites them to analyze the conformance between the observed (event log) and expected behaviour (model) of the process, with an emphasis on providing process owners with interpretable and understandable conformance results, in terms of a report. We further encourage participants to use any tools or technique at their disposal, including open-sourced or proprietary ones, as well as those implemented specifically for this challenge.

# The challenge (problem statement)

Given a process model and event log, describe a "good" process conformance analytics that summarizes commonalities and discrepancies between the processes captured in the model and recorded in the log. Your description must address the assessment criteria listed below.

## ASSESSMENT CRITERIA

### BENEFIT (40%)
Demonstrate the benefit of the applied technique, both in this particular case and in general

- benefit of your process conformance analytics technique in the current context 
- show that the results are insightful for the defined stakeholders
- potential and confirmed benefits of using your process conformance analytics in organizations, including:
- data science, business analytics, and business intelligence use cases it can support/enable;
- business decisions it can inform or automate; and
- ...

### NOVELTY (20%)
Discuss how your process conformance analytics is different from that already available, including:
- contribution to a gap in research on conformance checking;
- innovation of the analytics; and
- ...

### EFFICIENCY (20%)
Discuss how efficient are the algorithms that construct your process conformance analytics, including:
- theoretical aspects of the computational efficiency of the algorithms;
- practical aspects of the computational efficiency of the algorithms; and
- ...

### UNDERSTANDABILITY (20%)
Discuss aspects related to the understandability of your process conformance analytics by stakeholders, including:
- fit of the analytics for its purpose;
- clarity of the analytics; and
- ...
